# Deploying the NFS provisioner for Kubernetes

## Prerequisites

-   Configure the variables described in the section [\#](#)
-   Install the `kubectl` binary on your Ansible box as documented at [https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/user-access/kubectl/](https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/user-access/kubectl/)
-   Install the UCP Client bundle for the `admin` user as described at [https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/user-access/cli/\#download-client-certificates-by-using-the-rest-api](https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/user-access/cli/#download-client-certificates-by-using-the-rest-api)
-   Confirm that you can connect to the cluster by running a test command, for example, `kubectl get nodes`

## Running the playbook

Once the prerequisites are satisfied, run the appropriate playbook on your Ansible node:

```
# cd Docker-SimpliVity
# ansible-playbook -i vm_hosts playbooks/k8s-nfs-provisioner.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass

```

## Using NFS VM for post-deployment verification

In this example, it is assumed that the relevant variables are configured as follows:

|Variable|Value|
|:-------|:----|
|nfs\_provisioner\_role|`nfs-provisioner-runner`|
|nfs\_provisioner\_name|`hpe.com/nfs`|
|nfs\_provisioner\_storage\_class\_name|`**nfs**`|
|nfs\_provisioner\_server\_ip|`hpe-nfs.cloudra.local`|
|nfs\_provisioner\_server\_share|`/k8s`|

In this instance, the server IP is set to the NFS VM that has been deployed.

Ensure that your environment satisfies the prerequisites as described in [\#](#) and then run the playbook:

```
# cd Docker-SimpliVity
# ansible-playbook -i vm_hosts playbooks/k8s-nfs-provisioner.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass

```

Running the command `kubectl get sc` will show the storage class named `nfs`:

```

# kubectl get sc
NAME      PROVISIONER   AGE
nfs       hpe.com/nfs   5m

```

Create a temporary file `/tmp/pvc.yml` for a persistent volume claim \(PVC\) named `dynnfs-testpvc` with a storage class of `nfs` 

```
# cat /tmp/pvc.yml <<EOF
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: **dynnfs-testpvc**
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "**nfs**"
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Mi
EOF  

```

Create the PVC resource by running `kubectl apply` on this file.

```
# kubectl apply -f /tmp/pvc.yml
persistentvolumeclaim "dynnfs-testpvc" created
```

Verify that the corresponding persistent volume \(PV\) was created at the same time.

```
# kubectl get pv
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS    CLAIM                    STORAGECLASS   REASON    AGE
pvc-e685a9d2-8a6f-11e8-9025-0242ac110010   100Mi      RWX            Delete           Bound     default/dynnfs-testpvc   nfs                      4s

```

Define a pod that will mount the persistent volume through using the persistent volume claim. The persistent volume is mounted under `/tmp/foo`.

```
cat /tmp/pod.yml <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: **dynnfs-testpod**
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dynnfs-testpod
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dynnfs-testpod
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: pod-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: **dynnfs-testpvc**
      containers:
      - name: dynnfs-testpod
        command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - while true; do sleep 1; done
        image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: **/tmp/foo**
          name: pod-data
EOF
```

Create the pod resource by running `kubectl apply` on the file.

```
# kubectl apply -f /tmp/pod.yml
deployment.apps "dynnfs-testpod" created

```

Retrieve the pod ID and then execute a command in the pod to create a test file on the persistent volume. The file is named `/tmp/foo/bar.txt` and contains the string `hello`.

```
# pod=$(kubectl get pod | awk '/dynnfs-testpod-/ {print $1}')
# kubectl exec -it $pod -- sh -c "**echo hello \>/tmp/foo/bar.txt**"
```

In this example, where the NFS VM is being used as the storage back-end, you can examine the content of the folder containing the persistent volumes. Given the values specified above, where the NFS VM is named `hpe-nfs` and the `nfs_provisioner_server_share` is `k8s`, you can connect to the VM and explore the folder as follows.

```

# ssh hpe-nfs ls -R /k8s
/k8s:
default-dynnfs-testpvc-pvc-e685a9d2-8a6f-11e8-9025-0242ac110010
 
/k8s/default-dynnfs-testpvc-pvc-e685a9d2-8a6f-11e8-9025-0242ac110010:
**bar.txt**
```

Examine the contents of the file to ensure that the string `hello` has been persisted in the file `bar.txt`.

```

# ssh hpe-nfs cat /k8s/default-dynnfs-testpvc-pvc-e685a9d2-8a6f-11e8-9025-0242ac110010/bar.txt
**hello**
```
