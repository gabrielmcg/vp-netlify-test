#  Introduction

The playbooks are intended to be used to deploy a new environment. You should only use them for Day 0 deployment purposes.

The Ansible log is stored in the folder `/root/Docker-SimpliVity`. If the deployment fails, you may find useful hints in this log.

To see how to check if your certs have been deployed correctly, see Appendix D.
