# Docker EE Environment

Each release of Docker Enterprise Edition contains three technology components – UCP, DTR and the Docker Daemon or Engine. It is imperative that the components belonging to the same version are deployed or upgraded together – see [\#dockeree-components-table-content](#dockeree-components-table-content) 

A banner will be displayed on the UI, as shown in [\#docker-update](#docker-update), when an update is available for UCP or DTR. You can start the upgrade process by clicking on the banner.
